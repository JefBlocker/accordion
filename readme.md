Assignment 10: Accordion

The learning objectives of this assignment are to understand how to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM, and understand how CSS transitions work and why they are beneficial.

The performance objectives for this assignment are to effectively use jQuery and CSS animations.

The requiresments for this assignment are to build a jQuery accordion without using slideUp, slideDown, or slideToggle; therefore, only using CSS3 transitions, and should work on two or more sections.

Each paragraph in each section of the accordion is different lengths, as to learn how to deal with variable content length.

I have created a repository with the following:

- index.html
- main.scss & main.css
- main.js
- Readme.md
